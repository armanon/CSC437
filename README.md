Hey professor!

This is the inital start of a Music app I am creating, as of right now called The Music Library. My inspiration was to make a website similar to Spotify or other web player apps for music as music is a big part of my life and I thought it'd be cool to make an app like that. So far, I've followed the lab instrcutions pretty specifically to the best of my ability. It might not be pretty or picture perfect-esque but the goal is to make its design in the next coming weeks/implementations. Key to note that it is also very basic!! Do not fear as that will change. 

As of right now, on the front page when I click for the click preview it shows the contents of the page on the front page. If you navigate to the actual page (file:///C:/Users/arman/csc437/packages/proto/public/fragments/genre-details.html) For example, the actual page is displayed. I'm trying to think of a way to maybe have a hover option where when you hover the mouse over it instead of a click preview it'll show the contents, and then when you actually click it it takes you to the genuine page, still figuring that out though.

Thanks again for all the help!
